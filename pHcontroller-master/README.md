# pHcontroller
Arduino based swimming pool pH monitor and pump controller.

This project measures the pH of pool water as it passes the pump and injects a pH reducer
if the pH is too high. The pH tends to rise when it is used and also over time. The ideal pH
is 7.2.

## Components
* Arduino Uno
* LCD display with four buttons
* RTC (DS1302 chip)
* pH monitor board
* Relay
* Peristaltic pump
* Temperature and humidity sensor
* 12V Power supply
